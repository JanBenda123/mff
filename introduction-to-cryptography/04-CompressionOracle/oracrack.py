# Possible inputs:
#   'single char'   -   appends the character to the flag guess - must come from the alphabeth defined in code
#   'empty string'  -   repeats the guess with current flag
#   ..              -   removes last character from the guessed flag
#   -repeats <int>  -   modifies the number of repeats of the guess in a single payload 
#   -fillsize <int> -   modifies the fill size between guesses in a single payload 
#   -rounds <int>   -   modifies the number of rounds in a guess 
#   -method <str>   -   changes how are guesses ranked based on obtained data
#                       - sum   : sums the lenghts of outputs from each try
#                       - avg   : counts how many times was letter more compressed than average
#                       - med   : counts how many times was letter more compressed than 50% of results (more than median case)
#                       - first : counts how many times was letter among the most compressed in each run
